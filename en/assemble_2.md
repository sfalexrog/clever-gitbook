## Assembly order

### Installation of motors

* Unpack the motors. Using pliers, shorten the wires on the motors by cutting half the length (leaving about 25 mm).

![brrc2205 motor](../assets/brrc2205.png)

Strip

* remove 2 mm of insulation from the ends of the wire without damaging the copper strands.

Twist the wires.

Blanch

* Apply flux to the exposed part of the wire.
* Cover the solder using tweezers.

![Blanching](../assets/zap.jpg)

#### Fix the motor on the beam

* Install the motor on the engraved side of the beam.
* Attach the motors to the beams with М3х8 screws using a screwdriver.

![Fix the motor on the beam](../assets/brrc2205on.jpg)

* Beams with motors should be arranged according to the diagram. The arrows indicate the direction of motors rotation.

![Rotation of motors](../assets/brrc2205ondeck.jpg)

### Blanch three contact pads of the adjuster

* Apply flux
* Apply solder

To make solder neatly fill the entire pad, warm up the contact pad of the adjuster. For this purpose, hold the tip of the soldering gun to the contact pad for 2 seconds (or more if needed)

![Blanching of the adjuster contact pads](../assets/escDYSzap.png)

* Repeat this operation for the remaining three ESC

### Solder the wires of the motors to the ESC

Solder the prepared wires of the motors to the pads of ESC.

![Solder wires of motors to ESC](../assets/solderingBrrc2205ondeckTOescDYSzap.png)

* Repeat this operation for the remaining three ESC

### Installation of power connectors

#### Preparing wires for XT60 power connectors

1. Take a bundle of red and black wires marked 14AWG
2. Cut 4 pieces of wire of the following lengths
* Length 7 cm (XT60 pin power connector) - 1 red, 1 black
* Length 9 cm (XT60 socket power connector) - 1 red, 1 black

![Preparing wires for the power connector](../assets/cutwire14AWG.jpg)

#### Preparing XT60 pin and XT60 socket high-power connectors

[Article about high-power connectors and their designations](connectortypes.md)

![XT60 high-power connector](../assets/xt60pinsocket.jpg)

1. Blanch two red and black 14AWG power wires 7 cm long for the XT60 pin connector .
2. Blanch contact pads of the XT60 pin connector.
3. Solder the black wire to the “-” contact of the connector.
4. Solder the red wire to the “+” contact of the connector .
5. Cut ⌀5 thermal contraction tube (2 sections × 10 mm).
6. Put the ⌀5 thermal contraction tube on the wires so that it covers the contact pads of the wires from XT60.
7. Shrink the thermal contraction tube with a hot air gun. ![Installation of XT60 connectors](../assets/mountxt60pinsocket.png)
8. Repeat the procedure for XT60 socket connector.

#### Preparation of the power connector for the 5V control circuit

1. Trim/pull all pins from one of the connectors. Disconnect it.
2. Using a utility knife, pry the retainer off on the remaining connector to release the 3rd wire.
3. Remove the 3rd (orange) wire from the connector, since it is not needed.
4. The length of the remaining black and red wires should be 10 – 12 cm.

![Installation of the 5V connector](../assets/mount5vconnector.jpg)

### Installation of the power distribution board

#### Pre-soldering check

[Article about continuity test](test_connection.md)

![ Pre-soldering check](../assets/startPDBtest.jpg)

Check OPEN CONDITION of the following circuits (absence of the multimeter sound signal):

* “BAT+” and “BAT-”
* “12V” and “GND”
* “5V” and “GND”

Check CLOSED CONDITION of the following circuits (presence of the multimeter sound signal):

* “BAT-” with every contact marked “-” and “GND”
* “BAT+”, with every contact marked “+”

### Blanch the contact pads of the power board

1. [Blanch*] (zap.md) the contact pads of the power board
2. Using a multimeter, check absence of contact closure on the PCB (check continuity)

![ After-soldering check](../assets/zapPDBtest.jpg)

To make solder neatly fill the entire pad, it should be warmed up. For this purpose, hold the tip of the soldering gun to the contact pad for 2 seconds (or more if needed)

#### Soldering the XT60 high power connector

Solder the connector for battery, observing polarity on the contact pads.

![Soldering of XT60 to PDB](../assets/solderingxt60socketTOpdb.jpg)

IMPORTANT NOTE about polarity

* the red wire is “+”

## Safety notes for assembly ans configuration

1. Remove the propellers.“All ground operations are to be performed with propellers removed. Propellers are to be installed on the motors before the flight only.”
2. Disconnect the battery. Keep the power off. “Assembly, configuration, and maintenance should be performed with power disconnected. Connect power only for testing electronic components of the copter. After testing, power is to be disconnected before other works.”
3. Call for help. “If you experience problem when completing the task, contact the instructor or the teacher, do not try to solve the problem yourself.”

![Safety during assembly](../assets/safetybyassem.png)

## Security when working with 18650 Li-ion batteries

1. Handle batteries carefully. Avoid falls, bumps, and deformations.
2. When connecting (disconnecting) batteries, hold only the connectors, never pull or tug the wires.
3. If you see open connectors, violation of insulation or battery compartment integrity, do not touch it, and immediately inform the instructor.
