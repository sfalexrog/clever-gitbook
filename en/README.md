"Clever" is an educational constructor set of a programmable quadcopter that consists of popular open source components, and a set of necessary documentation and libraries for working with it.

The kit includes a Pixhawk/Pixracer flight controller with the PX4 flight stack, a Raspberry Pi 3 as a controlling onboard computer, and a camera module for performing flights with the use of computer vision, and a set of various sensors and other peripherals.

The same platform was used for creating many "large" projects of the Copter Express company, for example, drones for [autonomous pizza delivery promotion events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkAoZOtF58) (Samara, Kazan); a drone for coffee delivery at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, a autonomous quadcopter with charging station for site monitoring and security, winning drones in [Robocross-2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGbDaz_VmYU), [Robocross-2017](https://youtu.be/AQnd2CRczbQ)" competitions, and many others.
