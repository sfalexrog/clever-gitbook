# Contribution to Clever

Clever is mostly an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and [open hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) project aimed at lowering the entry threshold to development of the projects related to flying robotics. You can contribute to the project by offering fixes and improvements for Clever documentation and software.

> **Note** To offer changes to Clever documentation or SW, you should have an account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Markdown

All Clever documentation is written in the widespread [Markdown](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format. There are many guides on it on the Internet.

In Russian: https://guides.hexlet.io/markdown/.

In English: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started, https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.

For the ease of editing texts, you may use text editors with markdown support [Typora](https://typora.io), [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) (web), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Markdown Editor plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor).

For a local build of a static documentation website, use the [`gitbook-cli`](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-cli) utility.
